Some contra series try to warn beginners away from their experienced
dances, thus forcing themselves to address the question of what
defines an experienced dancer.  Here I reproduce a few such
definitions, complain about each one in turn, and then offer my own
for you to complain about.

Dancing Fool relies on self-selection.

Roughly, an experienced dancer is someone who read this and isn't
scared yet.

I dislike the way this approach is vulnerable to Dunning-Kruger
effect: briefly, unskilled individuals overrate themselves and highly
skilled individuals underrate themselves.  The usual explanation is
that the former fail to recognize how bad they are, while the latter
fail to recognize how bad others are.

#### [Concord Challenging Contras](http://www.tiac.net/~mabaker/challenging-contras.html)

Most dances I've seen follow the Concord model:

> You know how to do a roll away, California twirl, pass through to
> a wave, contra corners, and the basic moves without being taught

I think the intent here is to name figures which are mostly called at
advanced dances, as a way to select for people who have have attended
other advanced dances.  The principle is a bit circular, and the
particular choices here are odd: other than contra corners, all of
these are weekly fare at our local dances.  I know plenty of people
who can do all of them, and I would not call them advanced dancers.

> You know where to be at the start of each dance phrase and how to
> recover from a lapse

I think this is the important part: understanding the figures as
transformations of the set over time.  A new dancer thinks of a hey as
some inscrutable sequence of passing by right and left way too fast.
An experienced dancer knows that a hey is sixteen beats to come back
to where he started.

> You assist your partner and neighbor to the next move
>
> You execute flourishes safely and on time without disturbing others
