I don't personally argue that anyone else should learn to switch.  But
other people do, and here I've collected some of their arguments.  If
you're looking to be persuaded, read on.  Otherwise, keep dancing just
as you were.

## When the genders are imbalanced

In theory, people who can dance both roles can switch to the minority
role and keep dancing even when the genders are unbalanced.  Besides
keeping them dancing, it also improves the dance for those who dance
only a single role.

See [Jeff Kaufman's blog](http://www.jefftk.com/p/dance-both-roles)
for a more cogent presentation, and ensuing discussion.

## For gender and LGBTQ issues

I'm not even going to try to summarize this for fear of misspeaking.
If anyone wants to provide a short summary, I'm happy to quote it with
attribution.  Until then, perhaps it would be helpful to read the
"About Us" pages of the
[Heather and Rose](http://heatherandrose.org/about.shtml) and
[LCFD](http://lcfd.org/about/) organizations, or this (vehement) post
from the

blog.

## To liven up the choreography

I personally consider switching an embellishment on the called
choreography, much like twirling through a courtesy turn or continuing
a four-facing-four as an improper duple while you're out on the end.
It makes the dance more difficult and interesting.

## To improve one's dancing

Many dancers who switch report a newfound empathy which has in turn
improved their skill in their original role.  Certainly, I believe I
have a more intuitive understanding of hand placement during a swing
now that I've had quite a few gents' hands placed upon me.

Despite the number of times I've heard people make this claim on the
Facebook or during long car rides, I haven't found a good source
online.  The closest I've seen comes from a non-contra tradition:

## For a different contra experience

In many contras, the lady and gent have sufficiently different
choreography that switching is close to doing a whole new dance.  And
even when the called choreography is mostly symmetric, many figures
feel different from the two positions.
