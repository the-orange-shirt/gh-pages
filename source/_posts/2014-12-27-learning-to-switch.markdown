Like much of contra, switching is mostly taught informally, with
friends passing tips back and forth.  This is my attempt to summarize
what I've learned in the first year or so of trying to switch.  

I assume you don't need to be convinced to try switching.  Instead,
I'll start with general comments about learning to switch, and then
describe a few ways to switch during common figures.  

<!-- More -->

Comments are very welcome.  I don't claim to know a particularly great
deal about this, only more than anyone else who's bothered to write
about it on the internet.  (As far as I know, that's an empty set.)

## Learning to switch

This is the part where a stranger on the internet make assumptions
about you, and then tells you where, when, and with whom to switch.

#### I assume you are already an experienced dancer in one role.

People have various notions of what it means to be an experienced
dancer.  Here's
[mine]({% post_url 2014-12-28-defining-the-experienced-dancer %})

* you understand weight and timing
* for all the figures called during a typical night at your local
  dance, you can execute them by the call alone, and you know where
  each figure ends relative to where it started (e.g., a half hey ends
  in your corner's place)
* for all the formations seen during a typical night at your local
  dance, you know how the progression works

#### Where to practice?  Weekends and experienced events.

I assume your local dance doesn't have a lot of people who switch, or
that you don't know who they are.  Otherwise, you should go talk with
them instead of reading this.  Or better yet, ask them to dance.

But if your local dance doesn't have a practice of switching, and
regulars who switch, I recommend you practice at weekends and other
experienced events first.  This might seem counter-intuitive, because
weekends also feature more complicated choreography.  I've found
complicated choreography to be less of a hindrance than unhelpful
neighbors.

A few reactions I have to deal with less frequently with experienced
neighbors: Some new dancers will think they're the ones who have
switched, and switch themselves to "match" you.  Some will think
you've done it accidentally, and try to "un-switch" you.  Some will
just get confused and wander around in strange ways.

Meanwhile, at more experienced dances my neighbors lead me into the
right figures, and fix things when I make mistakes.  I'm lucky that my
local dance is in some sense the birthplace of CDSS, and has regulars
who have been dancing longer than I've been alive.  I am much more
willing to try new things when I know that no matter what I do, the
set is not going to fall apart around me.

In my experience, non-experienced gender-free contras are also
not good places to start switching.  I've written more about this
[elsewhere]({% post_url 2014-12-28-switching-roles-at-gender-free-contra %}),
but briefly, the slogan "places not faces" assumes that people know
where the places are, and that has not been my experience.  If you
would like to support gender-free contra, I currently think
experienced dancers can best do that by dancing the role they know
better at gender-free events, and switching at non-gender-free events.

#### When to switch?  Ends, progressions, whenever.

I went through three stages:

- At first, I went through the line once as a gent, used the time out
  at the end to watch the lady's part, and then came back in switched.
- Later I started switching on every progression, on the same figure
  each time, so that it felt like a double-long contra with extremely
  parallel construction.
- Now I switch pretty much without forethought, averaging once per
  progression.  I keep track by **turning my hands** up when I'm a
  gent and down when I'm a lady.  This is also a signal to my partner.

#### With whom to dance?  Look for buttons and women.

First of all, most people don't take it amiss when I ask, "Do you ever
switch roles?"  But if you're in a big room of strangers and you'd
like to guess which ones are likely to say yes, here are a couple of
completely unscientific heuristics I've developed.

One excellent heuristic is to look for a dance button that says the
wearer can switch.  I've seen three versions:

- white, "Would you like to lead or follow?"
- rainbow stripes,"What's your preference?  I dance both roles."
- white with a black pointer that can be moved between "Lead,"
  "Follow," and "Switch."
  
A less reliable heuristic is to look for a woman.  At many dances,
there are more women than men, and some women will learn the gent's
role just to avoid sitting out.  It helps that it is often more
acceptable for two women to dance together than two men.

But, again, most people don't take it amiss if I ask, "Do you ever
switch roles?"  So it's often worth asking.

<small> This section is probably where my male bias is most evident.
Women looking to practice the gent's role can, of course, just ask any
woman.  Although I'm told they rarely get an opportunity to look
around the room and pick a partner. </small>

## How to switch, by figure

For brevity, I use male pronouns for the person who starts in the
gent's place, and female pronouns for the person who starts in the
lady's place.  Of course, I believe it is acceptable to for men to
dance the lady's role and vice versa.

A sad majority of the switches I know happen during the swing.  **I'd
love to learn some more switches for other figures.**

I don't credit my sources because I don't know if they want their
names on the internet and in most cases I only remember them as "guy
in a kilt...maybe at Flurry?"  But I definitely don't mean to imply
that I invented any of these myself.

#### Swing

* **The easiest way** is to enter a balance and swing with my palms
  turned the other way.  This gives my partner four beats to notice
  the switch, and then I have eight to twelve beats to remember my
  partner's part. If there is no balance, I instead enter the swing
  switched, which is almost as good.

* Both dancers swing in their original roles in the ballroom position,
  but exit by opening on the non-pointy end.  The lady stops on the
  left and rolls the the gent away to her right to end switched.
  
  Sometimes, if I forgot to ask before the walk-through but suspect
  that my partner does switch, I test the waters by entering a swing
  as a lady and then exiting with a roll-away to switch back to the
  gent's role.  I also do this as playful flourish with neighbors whom
  I know can switch.
  
* End the swing facing out, then turn alone to face in switched.
  Although if I just end the swing facing out, sometimes people think
  it was accidental and try to fix it.  I try to head this off by
  adding a flourish that isn't strange to do facing out, e.g.,
  
  - swing in a cuddle, shallow side dip facing out, twirl out of the
    cuddle in (switched) place
  - deep dip with the lady's head pointing out of the set 

* Swing in a symmetric position, or switch to a symmetric position
  during the swing, and exit with the lady twirling the gent into the
  right-hand place.  E.g.,

  - right hands as in ballroom and left hands clasped overhead;
    standard under-arm twirl with left hands joined above
  - right hands as in ballroom, left arms around outside the
    other's right elbow, and left hands clasped below; twirl by
    disengaging the right arm and lifting the joined left hands above
  - cross-hand hold, right hands above left; twirl out as if twirling
    out of a skater's promenade

* In the middle of a ballroom swing, gent twirls the lady out and
  catches her again, in switched position.
  
* Gent offers the lady a right-handed balance, boxes the gnat, then
  passes the lady behind him.  The exit position is the entry position
  for a ripcord twirl, a.k.a. a swing-dancer's Apache twirl-out.
    
* Gent lifts his right hand holding the lady's left hand and turns
  under to enter a cuddle-up swing, switched.  If the gent leads this,
  it's easier to lead the lady's hand if he balances palms up.
  
* Cuddle-up swing with the lady on the left, end switched.
  
#### Long lines

* If partner is on the side, roll away with a half chasse as long
  lines retreat.

* If partner is across, swap places before long lines retreat.  I
  usually just grab my partner by the shoulders and move him.  I don't
  do this with women I don't know well, for hopefully obvious reasons.
  
#### By skipping figures that switch partners

* Substitute a balance for California twirl, star through, box the
  gnat, or swat the flea.
  
* Turn alone instead of as a couple, or vice versa.

* Substitute a back-and-forth pousette for a draw pousette, or vice
  versa.

* For interrupted square through two, skip the partner pull by.  I
  rarely have success putting in a balance, probably because a pull by
  is two beats and the usual balance takes four.

* Add a half-turn to an allemande, gypsy, or do-si-do.  A gypsy can be
  done faster by taking hands; it still "feels" like a gypsy if you
  maintain eye contact.  A do-si-do can be done faster without
  twirling.  If it's still too slow, substitute a swing.
  
#### Contra corners 

Switching during contra corners is usually unproductive, since this
figure almost always leads into a partner swing.  Also, you run the
risk of confusing your corners, without whose assistance you may not
be able to complete the figure.  But when it works, it's *so* cool.

* Enter with a riccochet while twirling over one's left shoulder into
  an allemande left with partner's first corner.  This one is hard.
  I've only pulled it off once, and I'm pretty sure all the credit for
  that occasion belongs to my partner.
  
* If entering via a half figure eight, instead lead and cast, ending
  on the same side.
  
#### Petronella

* Whoever is on the right rolls the other from left to right, without
  moving.  So the person on the left progresses two places, the person
  on the right stays still, and they end as if both had stepped to the
  right and then switched.
  
* A variation that's harder to lead without advance notice is to twirl
  whoever is moving.  The twirl is over his left shoulder.
    
#### Ladies chain

* Taking a courtesy turn position, the gent stops the lady as they are
  both facing out, and twirls them both in place to face in, switched.
  
  - If the tempo is slow enough, one can often sneak in a shallow
    side-dip before the twirl.  
  - Or courtesy turn a full circle to face back out, then twirl.
  - Or courtesy turn, ending with lady on the right and both facing
    in, then twirl the lady into the gent's place.
  
* Gent leads one twirl with his right hand lifting the lady's left,
  then rolls the lady from right to left with a half-chasse for
  himself.  This often requires a slow tempo.
  
#### Misc

* Riccochet with partner during a hey.

* Enter a couple zig-zag with a roll-away, no half chasse.
