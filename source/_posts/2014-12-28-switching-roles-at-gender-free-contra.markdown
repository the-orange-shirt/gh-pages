I tried switching roles at a gender-free contra and was surprised by
how poorly that went.  Friends who have attended other gender-free
contras report similar experiences, with one notable exception.  LCFD
camp is apparently a great place to switch.

I hypothesize that the important factor here is not the gender-free
but rather inexperience, and propose a few ways for experienced
dancers to support gender-free contra.

## I did not have fun switching at a gender-free contra

One of my local contra series is a gender-free dance, which means that
they encourage people to dance either role without regard for
presented gender.  To facilitate this, they issue armbands to those
wishing to dance the gent's role, and the caller says "bands" and
"bare arms" in lieu of "gent" and "lady" with their implied genders.
A common refrain at these dances is "places not faces," meaning that a
man in the lady's place should be treated as a lady.

So I went there and started switching, and it did not go well.  People
often stopped and looked around in confusion.  Some of them wandered
off as if searching for other neighbors.  People reached for my
partner instead of me.  With each mistake, we made everyone late.
Once, I ended a neighbor swing in the gent's place, kicking off a wave
of unwanted chaos that brought the entire set to a screeching halt.

## Gender-free dances attract inexperienced dancers.

Was the gender-free bit more aspirational than descriptive?  Was this
one dance just exceptionally bad?  No, probably not.  After hearing
similar stories from friends around the country, I now think that a
good mental model for my experience is inexperience.

Gender-free contra typically attracts inexperienced dancers, who
then make all the typical new dancer mistakes regardless of who is
dancing which part.

This explains all the other newbie mistakes I saw: the neighbors that
swung like pogo sticks; the couples that came back in without
switching and kept trying to dance their original roles; the wavy
lines that balanced tentatively, late, and in the wrong direction.

It also explains why the LCFD dance camps have such good dancing.  The
commitment, in time and money, deters casual dancers.  And for dancers
both serious enough to commit to a weekend, and also looking for
gender-free contra, LCFD is the only game in town.  So if the problem
with gender-free contra is the inexperienced dancers, it makes sense
that LCFD camps don't have that problem.

One might ask why different dance series in the same city can have
such widely varying levels of skill among its regulars.  A factor is
certainly the segregation between dancers from different series.  Some
regulars from the other series attend the gender-free dances.  I
rarely see the gender-free dancers at other dances.  As for why they
don't attend other dances, on that I am not qualified even to
speculate.  I suspect the answer would be well outside the scope of
this contra-focused blog.

## Supporting gender-free contra

What a shame that a dance which seems so perfectly suited for people
to learn to switch, is such a horrible place for people to learn to
switch.  For a while, I kept going anyway, but lately I've found a
group of people who switch at a more experienced series.  And that
series lets me work for my admission.

If you want to be a better person than I was, I suggest dancing a role
you know well at gender-free contras and
[learning to switch elsewhere](/blog/2014/12/27/learning-to-switch).

At gender-free contras, be the helpful experienced dancer holding the
set together.  Ask partners if they would like to practice a swing
while out at the end.  Make friends and invite them to other dances.

Elsewhere, if the local culture allows, switch.  The gender-free
calling is probably a lost cause, but maybe your example will make
non-gender-free dances a little more welcoming to the gender-free
dancers.
