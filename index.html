  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Ways to switch roles in contra, by figure</h1>

<p>foo</p>

<p>I recently started switching roles on each progression, and was
annoyed by how much I had to rediscover on my own.  Like much of
contra, switching is mostly taught informally, with friends passing
tips back and forth.  This is my attempt to summarize what I&rsquo;ve
learned in the first year or so of trying to switch.</p>

<p>I assume you don&rsquo;t need to be convinced to try switching.  Instead,
I&rsquo;ll start with general comments about learning to switch, and then
describe a few ways to switch during common figures.</p>

<h2>Learning to switch</h2>

<p>I assume your local dance doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of people who switch.  If
it did, you should go talk with them instead of reading this.  Or
better yet, ask them to dance!</p>

<p>I recommend learning at a large dance weekend or other experienced
venue.  You&rsquo;ll be more likely to find a partner who switches, and your
neighbors will be on average more experienced dancers who can recover
from your mistakes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found complicated choreography to be less of a hindrance than
unhelpful neighbors.  Some people will think they&rsquo;re the one&rsquo;s who
have switched, and try to un-switch.  Some people will think you&rsquo;ve
done it to yourselves accidentally, and try to un-switch you.  I don&rsquo;t
have as much trouble with either of these at more experienced dances.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a partner, some people who like to switch have
dance buttons that advertise this.  Mark Galipeau from SF originally
distributed a white one that asked, &ldquo;Would you like to lead or
follow?&rdquo;  His second batch has a rainbow background and instead asks,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your preference?  I dance both roles.&rdquo;  A third kind I&rsquo;ve seen
is a white button with a black pointer that can be moved to indicate
&ldquo;Lead,&rdquo; &ldquo;Follow,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Switch.&rdquo;  I don&rsquo;t know who made that one.</p>

<p>Absent an explicit sign like a dance button, most people won&rsquo;t take it
amiss if you ask, &ldquo;Do you ever switch roles?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>At first, I would go through the line once as a gent to learn the
choreography and switch at the end.  Later I started switching on
every progression, on the same figure each time.  Now I switch pretty
much without forethought, averaging once per progression.</p>

<p>I find it helps to stick to the convention that gents holds their
palms up and ladies their palms down.  This serves both as a reminder
to me and as a signal to my partner.</p>

<h2>How to switch, by figure</h2>

<p>For brevity, I use male pronouns for the person who starts in the
gent&rsquo;s place, and female pronouns for the person who starts in the
lady&rsquo;s place.  Of course, I believe it is acceptable to for men to
dance the lady&rsquo;s role and vice versa.</p>

<p>The easiest way is to enter a balance and swing with my palms turned
the other way.  This gives my partner four beats to notice the switch,
and then I have eight to twelve beats to remember my partner&rsquo;s part.
If there is no balance, I instead enter the swing switched, which is
almost as good.</p>

<h2>Swing</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Toward the end of the swing, lady passes the gent&rsquo;s left hand from
her right to her left hand and puts her right hand behind his
shoulder as the gent does in ballroom.  They now have left hands
joined between them about chin level.  The lady twirls the gent out
with her left hand to end switched.</p></li>
<li><p>Both dancers swing in their original roles, but exit with the lady
stopping on the left and letting the gent roll away into the lady&rsquo;s
place.</p></li>
<li><p>Swing in a symmetric hold and exit with the lady twirling the gent
into the right-hand place.  E.g.,</p>

<ul>
<li>right hands as in ballroom and left hands clasped overhead;
standard under-arm twirl with left hands joined above</li>
<li>right hands as in ballroom, left arms around outside the
other&rsquo;s right elbow, and left hands clasped below; twirl by
disengaging the right arm and lifting the joined left hands above</li>
<li>cross-hand hold, right hands above left; twirl out as if twirling
out of a skater&rsquo;s promenade</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>In the middle of a ballroom swing, gent twirls the lady out and
catches her again, in switched position.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Balance and swing</h2>

<p>If my partner knows the convention of gents turning their palms up and
ladies their palms down, I often signal a switch by balancing with my
hands turned the other way.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Gent offers the lady a right-handed balance, boxes the gnat, then
passes the lady behind him.  He finishes with his right hand behind
his back placing the lady&rsquo;s hand on his left shoulder blade and his
left hand dropping onto her right shoulder to enter a ballroom
swing, switched.</p>

<ul>
<li>The exit position is the entry position for a ripcord twirl,
a.k.a. a swing-dancer&rsquo;s Apache twirl-out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Gent lifts his right hand holding the lady&rsquo;s left hand and turns
under to enter a cuddle-up swing, switched.  If the gent leads this,
it&rsquo;s easier to lead the lady&rsquo;s hand if he balances palms up.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Long lines</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>If partner is on the side, roll away with a half chasse as long
lines retreat</p></li>
<li><p>If partner is across, swap places with a half-turn of a barrel hold
swing before long lines retreat.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>By skipping figures that switch partners</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Substitute a balance for California twirl, star through, box the
gnat, or swat the flea.</p></li>
<li><p>Turn alone instead of as a couple (or vice versa).</p></li>
<li><p>For interrupted square through two, skip the partner pull by.  I
rarely have success putting in a balance, probably because a pull by
is two beats and the usual balance takes four.</p></li>
<li><p>I don&rsquo;t often try to add half-turns to allemande, gypsy, and do si
do.  Many dances allow three or four beats per half-turn, so adding
a half-turn usually feels rushed.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Contra corners</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Instead of turning partner halfway, riccochet while twirling over
one&rsquo;s right shoulder into an allemande left with partner&rsquo;s corner.</p></li>
<li><p>If entering via a half figure eight, instead lead and cast, ending
on the same side.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Petronella</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Whoever is on the right rolls the other from left to right, without
moving.  They end as if both had stepped to the right and then
switched.</p>

<ul>
<li>A variation that&rsquo;s harder to lead without advance notice is to
twirl whoever is moving.  The twirl is over his left shoulder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Ladies chain</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Taking a courtesy turn position, the gent stops the lady as they are
both facing out, and twirls them both in place to face in, switched.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the tempo is slow enough, one can often sneak in a shallow
side-dip before the twirl.</li>
<li>Or courtesy turn a full circle to face back out, then twirl.</li>
<li>Or courtesy turn, ending with lady on the right and both facing
in, then twirl the lady into the gent&rsquo;s place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Gent leads one twirl with his right hand lifting the lady&rsquo;s left,
then rolls the lady from right to left with a half-chasse for
himself.  This often requires a slow tempo.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Hey</h2>

<ul>
<li>If the call is to pass partner, riccochet instead.  This is easy in
the middle and harder at the ends, but can be done at both.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Rory O&#8217;Moore</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>If the call is to balance and slide past partner, switch hands
coming out of the last balance and allemande instead.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>E.g., if the call is balance right, balance left, slide right,
then one would instead balance right and left, and allemande left
one turn.</p></li>
<li><p>The timing is tight enough that this is virtually impossible to
teach in the moment.  If I haven&rsquo;t achieved a cross-hands grip by
the fourth beat of the last balance, the switch will probably fail.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
