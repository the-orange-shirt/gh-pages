    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Like much of contra, switching is mostly taught informally, with
friends passing tips back and forth.  This is my attempt to summarize
what I&rsquo;ve learned in the first year or so of trying to switch.</p>

<p>I assume you don&rsquo;t need to be convinced to try switching.  Instead,
I&rsquo;ll start with general comments about learning to switch, and then
describe a few ways to switch during common figures.  Comments are
very welcome.</p>

<h2>Learning to switch</h2>

<p>I assume your local dance doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of people who switch, or
that you don&rsquo;t know who they are.  Otherwise, you should go talk with
them instead of reading this.  Or better yet, ask them to dance.</p>

<p><strong>I recommend learning at a large dance weekend or other experienced
venue.</strong> You&rsquo;ll be more likely to find a partner who switches, and
your neighbors will be on average more experienced dancers who can
recover from your mistakes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found complicated choreography to be less of a hindrance than
unhelpful neighbors.  Some people will think they&rsquo;re the one&rsquo;s who
have switched, and try to un-switch.  Some people will think you&rsquo;ve
done it to yourselves accidentally, and try to un-switch you.  I don&rsquo;t
have as much trouble with either of these at more experienced dances.</p>

<p><strong>If you&rsquo;re looking for a partner</strong>, some people who switch have dance
buttons that advertise this.  Mark Galipeau from SF originally
distributed a white one that asked, &ldquo;Would you like to lead or
follow?&rdquo;  His second batch has a rainbow background and instead asks,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your preference?  I dance both roles.&rdquo;  A third kind I&rsquo;ve seen
is a white button with a black pointer that can be moved to indicate
&ldquo;Lead,&rdquo; &ldquo;Follow,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Switch.&rdquo;  I don&rsquo;t know who made that one.</p>

<p>Absent an explicit sign like a dance button, most people don&rsquo;t take it
amiss when I ask, &ldquo;Do you ever switch roles?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>At first, I would go through the line once as a gent to learn the
choreography and switch at the end.  Later I started switching on
every progression, on the same figure each time.  Now I switch pretty
much without forethought, averaging once per progression.</p>

<p><strong>I find hand orientation a helpful reminder</strong>.  I turn my palms up
when I&rsquo;m a gent and down when I&rsquo;m a lady.  This can also be a signal
to my partner.</p>

<h2>How to switch, by figure</h2>

<p>For brevity, I use male pronouns for the person who starts in the
gent&rsquo;s place, and female pronouns for the person who starts in the
lady&rsquo;s place.  Of course, I believe it is acceptable to for men to
dance the lady&rsquo;s role and vice versa.</p>

<h4>Swing</h4>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The easiest way</strong> is to enter a balance and swing with my palms
turned the other way.  This gives my partner four beats to notice
the switch, and then I have eight to twelve beats to remember my
partner&rsquo;s part. If there is no balance, I instead enter the swing
switched, which is almost as good.</p></li>
<li><p>Both dancers swing in their original roles, but exit with the lady
stopping on the left and letting the gent roll away into the lady&rsquo;s
place.</p></li>
<li><p>Swing in a symmetric position, or switch to a symmetric position
during the swing, and exit with the lady twirling the gent into the
right-hand place.  E.g.,</p>

<ul>
<li>right hands as in ballroom and left hands clasped overhead;
standard under-arm twirl with left hands joined above</li>
<li>right hands as in ballroom, left arms around outside the
other&rsquo;s right elbow, and left hands clasped below; twirl by
disengaging the right arm and lifting the joined left hands above</li>
<li>cross-hand hold, right hands above left; twirl out as if twirling
out of a skater&rsquo;s promenade</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>In the middle of a ballroom swing, gent twirls the lady out and
catches her again, in switched position.</p></li>
<li><p>Gent offers the lady a right-handed balance, boxes the gnat, then
passes the lady behind him.  The exit position is the entry position
for a ripcord twirl, a.k.a. a swing-dancer&rsquo;s Apache twirl-out.</p></li>
<li><p>Gent lifts his right hand holding the lady&rsquo;s left hand and turns
under to enter a cuddle-up swing, switched.  If the gent leads this,
it&rsquo;s easier to lead the lady&rsquo;s hand if he balances palms up.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Long lines</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>If partner is on the side, roll away with a half chasse as long
lines retreat</p></li>
<li><p>If partner is across, swap places with a half-turn of a barrel hold
swing before long lines retreat.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>By skipping figures that switch partners</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Substitute a balance for California twirl, star through, box the
gnat, or swat the flea.</p></li>
<li><p>Turn alone instead of as a couple (or vice versa).</p></li>
<li><p>For interrupted square through two, skip the partner pull by.  I
rarely have success putting in a balance, probably because a pull by
is two beats and the usual balance takes four.</p></li>
<li><p>I don&rsquo;t often try to add half-turns to allemande, gypsy, and do si
do.  Many dances allow three or four beats per half-turn, so adding
a half-turn usually feels rushed.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Contra corners</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Instead of turning partner halfway, riccochet while twirling over
one&rsquo;s right shoulder into an allemande left with partner&rsquo;s corner.
This one is hard.  I&rsquo;ve only pulled it off once, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure
all the credit of that occasion belongs to my partner.</p></li>
<li><p>If entering via a half figure eight, instead lead and cast, ending
on the same side.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Petronella</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Whoever is on the right rolls the other from left to right, without
moving.  They end as if both had stepped to the right and then
switched.</p></li>
<li><p>A variation that&rsquo;s harder to lead without advance notice is to twirl
whoever is moving.  The twirl is over his left shoulder.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Ladies chain</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Taking a courtesy turn position, the gent stops the lady as they are
both facing out, and twirls them both in place to face in, switched.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the tempo is slow enough, one can often sneak in a shallow
side-dip before the twirl.</li>
<li>Or courtesy turn a full circle to face back out, then twirl.</li>
<li>Or courtesy turn, ending with lady on the right and both facing
in, then twirl the lady into the gent&rsquo;s place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Gent leads one twirl with his right hand lifting the lady&rsquo;s left,
then rolls the lady from right to left with a half-chasse for
himself.  This often requires a slow tempo.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Hey</h4>

<ul>
<li>If the call is to pass partner, riccochet instead.  This is easy in
the middle and harder at the ends, but can be done at both.</li>
</ul>
